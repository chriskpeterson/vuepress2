# Writing samples

Please find a link to some of the content I've created at HPE. These samples are mostly task, concept, and reference topics At HPE, I write user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and software and firmware compatibility matrices. In the past, I've written release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements for high-security customers.

Below, I've listed some of the programs I work on with a link to a writing sample for each.



## HPE Synergy

HPE Synergy is a flagship server product combining server, storage, and networking modules in a single chassis. This product is designed for environments where server workload flexibility is important. For example, a bank's IT department can configure HPE Synergy to run teller software during the day and configure it to run the bank's transaction database at night.

I'm responsible for creating a start here poster (printed and shipped in the box), a cabling guide, and the content for each software release. I also serve as a product expert evaluating all other deliverables to ensure content consistency and content sharing best practices.

## HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

The frame link module is the management module for HPE Synergy frames.  This module manages all power and cooling resources, management network traffic, and acts as a security guard allowing newly installed components to access the frame infrastructure.

For this program, I write a user guide for the hardware and software components.

## HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

The HPE ProLiant DL385 is a rack-based box server. This is one of the few products I work on that's not sold as a solution. The complexity in writing for servers is the numerous internal component configurations supported. 

For this program, I work on the various in-box print deliverables and the user guide. The content in HPE server guides doesn't change much, but there are small differences between products. These guides are the focus of my content reuse project currently in progress.

## ConvergedSystem 700

HPE ConvergedSystem 700 is pre-configured and purpose-built compute, networking, and storage solution designed using individual HPE components. This product is assembled and configured in a factory and delivered to customers as two or more racks of hardware. The challenge or this program is ensuring that all of the firmware and software work together. To support the customer, we deliver a tested and approved compatibility matrix along with step-by-step upgrade guides.

For this program, I write firmware and software compatibility matrices and the step-by-step upgrade guides. The upgrade guides include firmware updates, software updates, VMware ESXi configuration, and switch configuration.

## HPE SimpliVity 380

HPE Hyper Converged 380 (or HPE SimpliVity 380) is a node-based server solution allowing quick install, configuration, and enhanced scalability. This product is essentially a single server built to work as multiple products in one.

delivered as a single server and management software pre-configured with a focus on virtual machine deployment.

For this program I worked on the initial deployment which was run on an aggressive schedule.

## Topic analysis and rewrite exercise

I choose two topics providing some evaluation and minor rewrites.
