# Projects and Teams

Here are some projects I'm currently working on in my current role.

## Taxonomy and Metadata

Worked with our editing team to update the product documentation library taxonomy. As part of this project, I worked with Zoomin to implement their metadata to facets publishing plugin. Using this plugin ensures that topics utilize consistent metadata tagging and saves publishing time by a few hours.

## Create Task-Based Voice Documentation

Initiated a project to take the concept and reference-based administrator guides for voice and convert them to task-based guides.
This included creating a task template for this new type of task for our audience.

## API Documentation 

Investigated software to help our team write API documentation for both video and voice. I taught other team members how to run API commands on our voice products.

## Documentation Planning and Strategy

An integral member of the documentation team looking at ways to provide next-generation documentation. I'm investigating microcontent, personalized documentation, and methods for moving away from a book paradigm for delivering content.

## Content Templates (HPE)

Created a reuse template for server documentation leveraging the fact that most of the server guides are identical. The template allows writers to swap out the server name and images using a separate XML file. 

## Information Architecture team

Worked performed as part of this team:
* Provided consultation services for knowledge management writing teams on topic writing, sharing strategies, and DITA elements.
* Created best practice guides for topic planning and topic writing.
* Reviewed the approved DTD and update as necessary.

## Quality team

This team evaluates support cases that have been flagged for knowledge management. We access the cases and pull out any relevant information where documentation was a factor. In a recent win, we identified that customers didn't understand how to set up a particular server. We were able to borrow the server and confirmed that the process had some gotchas. We updated the procedures and realized a reduction in service calls. 

## Interactive documentation

I am very interested in interactive documentation delivery models. I believe we can reduce task complexity by allowing customers to choose options and retrieve relevant content. We realized this with the HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool. Customers reported fewer issues understanding the supported software and firmware for their solution. Even better, we received positive feedback from customers and the field.

### HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool

This firmware comparison tool allows customers to choose and compare two HPE Synergy Custom SPPs. I created this tool as a way to present a table with over fifteen columns to our customers.

### HPE ConvergedSystems 750 Interactive Matrix

This is very basic interactivity allowing the customer to filter through the firmware information in a table. 

### HPE DL380 Gen10 Cabling Matrix

This also uses the simple filter text field. The value add is allowing the customer to enter a cable or cable kit part number and identify supported cabling scenarios.

### Augmented Reality

A colleague and I create an augmented reality (AR) template tool for server cabling. This was done using JavaScript which has limited functionality for AR. We are currently looking at options to develop this further.

### Interactive Cabling diagrams
Working with the visual design team to code SVGs for interactivity allowing customers to click through complex cabling procedures.
