# Projects and Teams

At Poly and HPE, I participated in various workstreams and worked on products outside of my day-to-day writing responsibilities.

## Poly

### Taxonomy and Metadata

Worked with our editing team to update the product documentation library taxonomy. As part of this project, I worked with Zoomin to implement their metadata to facets publishing plugin. Using this plugin ensures that topics utilize consistent metadata tagging and saves publishing time by a few hours.

### Create Task-Based Voice Documentation

Initiated a project to take concept and reference topic-based administrator guides and convert them to task-based guides. This included creating a task template for this new type of task for our audience.

### API Documentation

Investigated software to help our team write API documentation for both video and voice. I taught other team members how to run API commands on our voice products.

### Documentation Planning and Strategy

An integral member of the documentation team looking at ways to provide next-generation documentation.

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

### Content Templates (HPE)

HPE server hardware documentation is nearly identical from one product to another. To streamline document creation, I developed a template to easily swap out images and the server name to easily update a guide without checking out topics.

### Information Architecture team

Worked performed as part of this team:

- Provided consultation services for knowledge management writing teams on topic writing, sharing strategies, and DITA elements.
- Created best practice guides for topic planning and topic writing.
- Reviewed the approved the DITA DTD and updated as necessary.

### Quality team

This team evaluates support cases flagged for potential documentation issues. In one case, we identified that customers continued to call in about a particular server setup procedure. We were able to borrow the server and confirmed that the process, as documented, was unclear. We updated the guide and leading to a reduction in service calls.

### Interactive documentation

I'm very interested in interactive documentation delivery models. I believe we can reduce task complexity by allowing customers to choose options and retrieve relevant content. We realized this with the HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool. Customers reported fewer issues understanding the supported software and firmware for their solution. Even better, we received positive feedback from customers and the field.

To promote the model for interactive docuementation, I worked with two colleagues to create a poster and white paper. These were used as part of an HPE technical information fair.

This is the abstract portion of the paper. I can share the ideas, but not the entire document as it's marked HPE confidential.

_Flexible, scalable, solution-based products require flexible, scalable, solution-based end-user documentation. A core responsibility of an information developer is to create user documentation that simplifies complex information and procedures. The standard one-size-fits-all approach to documentation creation and delivery adds an unnecessary burden to our customer’s search for product information. A better customer experience is realized by allowing customers to interact with documentation. This interaction sets the foundation for smarter documentation, where information is found quickly. In this paper, we propose a content delivery model that allows us to deliver interactive documentation to customers enabling quicker access to specific information. This content delivery model utilizes interactive web-based elements coded in JavaScript that can be added to content during publication to HTML. This solution is executed in TCE&Q Knowledge Management’s content development tool providing others in our organization a tool for dynamic content development._

#### HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool

This firmware comparison tool allows customers to choose and compare two HPE Synergy Custom SPPs. I created this tool as a way to present a table with over fifteen columns to our customers.

::: tip NOTE
The site uses a click "here" link which is not something I advocate for. For accessibility, the link should be "select a differemtn management combination."
:::

The screen capture shows an HPE Synergy management combination with two selected firmware packages. The **show differences** checkbox is checked causing the firmware differences to display as bold text.

#### HPE ConvergedSystems 750 Interactive Matrix

This is very basic interactivity allowing the customer to filter through the firmware information in a table. These small additions to documentation can save a lot of time searching for particular pieces of data.

#### HPE DL380 Gen10 Cabling Matrix

The cabling matrix also uses the simple filter text field. The matrix allows customers to enter a cable or cable kit part number and identify supported cabling scenarios.

### Augmented Reality

A colleague and I create an augmented reality (AR) template tool for server cabling. We created the AR experience with HTML and JavaScript. The experience only works with certain browsers due to limited functionality and phone security.

#### Interactive Cabling diagrams

I worked with the visual design team to coding SVGs for interactivity. This effort was to allow customers to click through complex cabling procedures. We didn't end up realizing this goal, but we did learn about SVG coding and functionality.
