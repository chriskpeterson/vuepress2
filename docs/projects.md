# Projects and teams

Here are some projects I'm currently working on in my current role.

## Content sharing
I'm currently working on a template for our server platform allowing writers to update multiple variable files to create a version specific to each server. Most of our server guides include the same topics, but they include specific product names and illustrations. Using one variable file for company and product-specific variables and another variable file for illustrations will greatly reduce topic duplication.

## Information Architecture team
On this team we:
* Provide consultation services for knowledge management writing teams on topic writing, sharing strategies, and DITA elements. 
* Addresses DTD issues such as missing elements (our environment uses a constrained DTD). 
* Transform issues related to elements (are writers using extra `<p>` tags for spacing? should every image be placed into a `<fig>`?).

## Quality team
This team evaluates support cases that have been flagged for knowledge management. We access the cases and pull out any relevant information where documentation was a factor. Typically the information exists, but the customer can't find it.  

## Interactive documentation
I am very interested in exploring documentation delivery that allows customer to select the information they need versus clicking through topics. I have been able to create a couple interactive deliverables.

### HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool
I created this tool and have passed on maintenance to another writer

### HPE ConvergedSystems 750 Interactive Matrix
This is very basic interactivity, but allows the user to filter through the table content.

### HPE DL380 Gen10 Cabling Matrix
This used the same interactivity as the Converged System Tool, but the value add is that a customer can enter a cable or cable kit part number and identify what it can be used to cable.

## Augmented Reality
A colleague and I create an augmented reality (AR) template tool for server cabling. (You can see it [HPE ProLiant Gen10 DL380 Cabling Matrix](https://techhub.hpe.com/eginfolib/servers/CableMatrix/GUID-76C9E454-E5AA-4A65-BA5E-132A7D306E07.html) here.) This was done using JavaScript which has limited functionality for AR. We are currently looking at options to developer this further.

## Interactive Cabling diagrams
Working with the visual design team to code SVGs for interactivity allowing customers to click-through complex cabling procedures.
