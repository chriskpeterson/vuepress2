# Documentation Planning and Strategy

At Poly and HPE, I participated in various work streams and department initiatives.

## Poly

### Publishing Update

Updated publishing....

* [Poly Documentation Library Redesign](/case-studies/poly-publishing-update)

Around the time I started working at Poly, they were discussing how to document third party apps running on Poly devices.


### API Documentation

**Tools**: Postman

Investigated software to help our team write API documentation for both video and voice. I taught other team members how to run API commands on our voice products.

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise


### Information Architecture team

Worked performed as part of this team:

- Provided consultation services for knowledge management writing teams on topic writing, sharing strategies, and DITA elements.
- Created best practice guides for topic planning and topic writing.
- Reviewed the approved the DITA DTD and updated as necessary.

### Quality team

This team evaluates support cases flagged for potential documentation issues. In one case, we identified that customers continued to call in about a particular server setup procedure. We were able to borrow the server and confirmed that the process, as documented, was unclear. We updated the guide and leading to a reduction in service calls.
