# Topic evaluation

### Original

> #### Powering on and off
> Connect power and power on the XYZ system after you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with it. Make sure that the system is powered off before you connect devices to it. It is important to note that XYZ systems do not have what you might think of as a power buttonâ€”they have a power proximity sensor. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power  on the front of the system.

## Rewrite

### First-time setup
#### Connecting peripherals

::: tip
The XYZ powers on with a proximity sensor power switch. The proximity sensor detects movement up to two inches.
:::
::: tip
Only connect peripherals when the product is powered off.
:::

1. Before connecting power to the product, connect all peripheral devices.
2. Connect power to the product.
3. Power on the product using the proximity power switch located on the front right-side of the codec.

### Topic questions
* Where is the sensor located?
* What happens if I move near the sensor in the middle of a call?
* What happens if I connect a peripheral with the power on?
	* The codec connects with peripherals during startup.
