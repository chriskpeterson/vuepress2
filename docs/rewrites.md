# Topic evaluation

### Original

#### Powering on and off
> Connect power and power on the RealPresence Group system after you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with it. Make sure that the system is powered off before you connect devices to it. It is important to note that Polycom RealPresence Group systems do not have what you might think of as a power buttonâ€”they have a power proximity sensor. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power  on the front of the system.

## Rewrite **

### First-time setup
#### Connecting peripherals

::: tip
The RealPresense Group series solution powers on with a proximity sensor power switch. The proximity sensor detects movement up to two inches.
:::
::: warning
Only connect peripherals when the solution is powered off.
:::

1. Before connecting power to the codec, connect all peripheral devices.
2. Connect power to the codec.
3. Power on the solution using the proximity power switch located on the front right-side of the codec.

### Explanation
* Reduce the word count and use simplified English for clear translation. It's not necessary to state what a product  doesn't have.
* State the result before the action to avoid.
* This doesn't appear to be a power on the system topic. It's two topics.
	* Connecting peripherals
	* Powering on the system
