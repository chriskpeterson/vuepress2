# Documentation rewrites

### Original

#### Powering on and off
Connect power and power on the RealPresence Group system after you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with it. Make sure that the system is powered off before you connect devices to it. It is important to note that Polycom RealPresence Group systems do not have what you might think of as a power buttonâ€”they have a power proximity sensor. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power  on the front of the system.

### Rewrite **

## First-time setup
#### Connecting peripherals

::: tip
The RealPresense Group series uses a proximity sensor to power the unit on and off. The proximity sensor senses movement up to two inches in front of the sensor.
:::

::: warning
Only connect peripherals when the system is powered off.
:::

1. Before connecting the unit to power, connect all peripheral devices.
2. Connect the unit to power.
3. Power on the system using the proximity power switch.

### Explanation
Reduce the wordcount and simplify the language for clear translation. It's not necessary to state what something doesn't have.

Also, it's best to not instruct something and then explain aftwerward that something else should be done first.

This doesn't appear to be a power on the system topic. It's two topics.
* Connecting peripherals
* Powering on the system
