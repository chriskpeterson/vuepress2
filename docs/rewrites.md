# Documentation rewrites


### Original

#### Powering on and off
Connect power and power on the RealPresence Group system after you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with it. Make sure that the system is powered off before you connect devices to it. It is important to note that Polycom RealPresence Group systems do not have what you might think of as a power button—they have a power proximity sensor. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power  on the front of the system.

### Rewrite

## First-time setup
#### Connecting peripherals

::: tip 

The RealPresense Group series proximity sensor powers on and off when it senses movement. The proximity sensor senses movement up to two inches from the sensor.

:::

1. With the system powered off, connect all peripheral devices to the main unit. 
2. Power on the system using the proximity power switch.


### Explanation

Reduce the wordcount and simplify the language for clear translation. It's not necessary to state what something doesn't have. 

Also, it's best to not instruct something and then explain aftwerward that something else should be done first.

This doesn't appear to be a power on the system topic. It's two topics. 
* Connecting peripherals
* Powering on the system
