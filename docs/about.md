# About

## Some information about me

Currently, I live in Houston, TX and work at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). At HPE, I focus on content for HPE Synergy and the AMD-based HPE ProLiant DL385 server. In our knowledge management group, I serve on the information architecture team, the quality team, and tools team. I help new writers learn the tools and help seasoned writers with troubleshooting. 

### Personal facts

I'm not much of a personal facts person. I like the standard things, I enjoy:
* Running (though I currently am nursing a broken toe)
* Road biking
* Playing guitar and writing music
* Convincing myself that 'this time' I'll get up and sing karaoke.


For what it's worth, I learned VuePress, Github, Netflify, and markdown to create this site. I'm new to this, but enjoy working through new processes and procedures.

### Some tools I use or am familiar with
* SDL (our current authoring database)
* XMetaL (our current authoring tool)
* Oxygen (I use Oxygen as a test and am begging my group to switch)
* AuthorIT (our old authoring environment)
* Vasont (also part of our old environment)
* Arbortext (also...)
* Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.)
* Some coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
