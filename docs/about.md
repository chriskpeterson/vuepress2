# About


Currently, I live in Houston, TX and work at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). At HPE, I focus on content for HPE Synergy and the AMD-based HPE ProLiant DL385 server. In our knowledge management group, I serve on the information architecture team, the quality team, and tools team. I help new writers learn the tools and help seasoned writers troubleshoot the tools.

### Personal facts

I'm not much of a personal facts person. I like the standard things, I enjoy:
* General exercise including running (though I'm currently nursing a broken toe) and biking.
* Playing guitar and writing music.
* Convincing myself that 'this time' I'll get up there and sing karaoke.
* Design. Not too long ago, I designed a chandelier for the Lululemon brand, Kit and Ace. Sadly, the store's no longer there and I don't know where the chandelier is.


For what it's worth, I learned VuePress, Github, Netflify, and markdown to create this site. I'm new to this, but enjoy learning new technology. 

### Some tools I use or am familiar with
* SDL (our current authoring database)
* XMetaL (our current authoring tool)
* Oxygen (I use Oxygen as a test and am begging my group to switch)
* AuthorIT (our old authoring environment)
* Vasont (also part of our old environment)
* Arbortext (also...)
* Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.)
* Some coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### University

I have two degrees
* BA English (first degree)
* BS Industrial Design (second degree)
For fun, here's some of my design work [ID Portfolio](https://www.behance.net/chriskpeterson)

### Volunteering

I typically like to have at least one volunteer effort at all times. Here are some places I've volunteered.
* LDS Peanut Butter Canary
This is an periodic effort through HPE. They put you to work, but you get to take some peanut butter home. 
* Friends for Life Animal Shelter - 1/2013 - 9/2018
Awesome animal shelter here in Houston. I generally helped with the adoption database. Through the years, they've help us find home for five dogs and two cats we rescued from the streets.
* Comp-U-Dopt
Refurbished corporate PCs with Ubuntu Linux for underserved families.
