# About

Currently, I live in Austin, TX and work at Poly (Polycom / Plantronics). At Poly I work on several projects from the video and voice product lines. I serve on the information architecture team and various other process teams in the group. I help new writers learn the tools and help seasoned writers troubleshoot the tools.

### Some personal facts

I like the standard things, like:

- General exercise including running (though I'm currently nursing a broken toe) and biking.
- Playing guitar and writing music.
- Convincing myself that 'this time' I'll get up there and sing karaoke.
- Design. Not too long ago, I designed a chandelier for the Lululemon brand, Kit and Ace. Sadly, the store's no longer there and I don't know where the chandelier is.
- Technology and learning. I learned VuePress, Github, Netflify, and markdown to create this site. I'm new to this, but enjoy learning new technology.
- I studied industrial design. For fun, here's some of my design work [ID Portfolio](https://www.behance.net/chriskpeterson)

### Volunteering

I typically like to have at least one volunteer effort at all times. Here are some places I've volunteered. Unfortunately, since moving to Austin, I haven't picked this back up. However, I hope to soon. When I lived in Austin in 2009, I volunteered at the Wright House Wellness Center.

- LDS Peanut Butter Canary

This was a periodic effort through HPE. They put you to work, but you get to take some peanut butter home.

- Friends for Life Animal Shelter - 1/2013 - 9/2019

Awesome animal shelter here in Houston. I generally helped with the adoption database. Through the years, they've help us find home for five dogs and two cats we rescued from the streets.

- Comp-U-Dopt

Refurbished corporate PCs with Ubuntu Linux for underserved families.

## What Impact Have a Had with Poly
