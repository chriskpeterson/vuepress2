# About

## Hello, I'm Chris the information developer.

Currently, I live in Houston, TX and work at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). At HPE, I focus on content for HPE Synergy and the AMD-based HPE ProLiant DL385. In our knowledge management group, I serve on the information architecture team, the quality team, and tools team. I help new writers learn the roaps and seasoned writers with tools issues.

Many years ago I completed a BA in English and moved to New York where I worked as the manager in a reinsurnace company's document services department. Here, I became fascinated with visual design as I learned to enhance graphics, create presentations, and assist marketing with in-house design.

This led me to apply to the University of Houston Industrial Design program. I was accepted and completed my degree in 2014. In 2013, I applied for an HP internship in visual design and haven't left. However, I did transition to the technical writing team where I utilize my writing and visual design skills.

My primary driver is helping others whether it's customers or colleagues. This is what drives me to dig in to technology, work on innovation efforts, participate on various teams, and continue to learn.

### Some things I enjoy include:
* Learning new technology
* Writing
* Running
* Playing guitar
