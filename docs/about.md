# About

## Hello, I'm Chris the information developer.

Currently, I live in Houston, TX and work at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). At HPE, I focus on content for HPE Synergy and the AMD-based HPE ProLiant DL385. In our knowledge management group, I serve on the information architecture team, the quality team, and tools team. I help new writers learn the roaps and seasoned writers with tools issues.

For what it's worth, I put this site together using VuePress, Netflify, and markdown. I'm new to this, but enjoy working through new processes and procedures.

### Some things I enjoy include:
* Learning new technology
* Writing
* Running
* Playing guitar
