# Writing Samples

At Poly, I write software administrator and user guides, hardware setup guides, and release notes for voice and video products.

At HPE, I wrote hardware and software user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and firmware compatibility matrices. In addition, I worked on release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements.

At both Poly and HPE, I worked on additional internal projects and served on workstreams. I included some of these projects in [Projects](projects.md).

Please use the links below to view writing samples from Poly and HPE.

## Poly

The technical communications group at Poly utilizes reuse across all products. Voice products, in particular, reuse much of the same content. For this reason, I don't have significant writing samples to share.

### Poly CCX Business Media Phones with UC Software

Helping launch the CCX phones was my first project at Poly. I have since turned this project over to a junior writer providing guidance and assistance.

### Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

The team views me as the problem solver. We had issues selling this product due to incomplete documentation. I took this over to help identify gaps in the information provided to us by our SMEs. This project demonstrates how working directly with the products ensures we can successfully advocate for the customer.

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I redesigned a start here poster, cabling guide, and software release content. To complete this project, I worked directly with the engineering team in the lab and had access to the product's virtual test environment.

### HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

I worked on various components of the HPE Synergy project, but the frame link module was my main product. I joined the team after the initial launch, quickly learning the product and becoming an information lead.

### HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

For this program, I work on in-the-box print deliverables and the user guide. HPE servers each have their separate guides, but there's a high percentage of reuse across the server guides.

### ConvergedSystem 700

The ConvergedSystem product consists of various HPE hardware components and software from multiple other companies. ConvergedSystems is a complex program because there are often compatibility issues. To upgrade the software or update the firmware, you must follow an exact sequence of steps across each product. For this program, I wrote firmware and software compatibility matrices and step-by-step upgrade guides.

### HPE Hyper Converged 380

The Hyper Converged 380 was a new product similar to ConvergedSystems, but with fewer components. I worked on the launch of this program as the writer for the user guide, compatibility matrix, and release notes.

## Topic analysis and rewrite exercise

To demonstrate how I think when writing or updating content, I choose two existing topics to evaluate and rewrite.
