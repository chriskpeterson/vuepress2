# Writing samples

These writing samples are a collection from Poly and HPE. These samples are mostly task, concept, and reference topics

At Poly, I write content software administrator and user guides, setup sheets, and release notes for voice and video products. Much of my time is spent managing projects including creating documentation plans, Jira tickets, and status updates. For the team, I also work on other internal projects and serve on internal teams. Some of these projects are outlined in [Projects](projects.md).

At HPE, I wrote user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and software and firmware compatibility matrices. In addition, I worked on release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements for high-security customers.

Below, I've listed some of the programs I work on with a link to a writing sample for each.

## Poly

The technical communications group at Poly utilizes reuse across all products. Voice products, in particular, reuse much of the same content. For this reason, I don't have significant writing samples to share.

### Poly CCX Business Media Phones with UC Software

### Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

For this project I helped the team identify gaps in the information provided to customers. I converted a PDF setup sheet into an HTML walkthrough deliverable.

### HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

For this program, I work on the various in-box print deliverables and the user guide. The content in HPE server guides doesn't change much, but there are small differences between products. These guides are the focus of my content reuse project currently in progress.
