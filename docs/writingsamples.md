# Writing samples

At HPE, I write user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and software and firmware compatibility matrices. In the past, I've written release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements for high-security customers.

Below, I've listed some of the programs I work on with a link to a few writing samples from each.


## HPE Synergy Frame Link Module
*The frame link module is a management module for HPE Synergy frames.  This module manages all power and cooling resources in a frame in addition to managing all network traffic to and from a frame.* 

*For this program, I write a user guide for the hardware and software components.*

## HPE Synergy

*HPE Synergy is a premier program at HPE. The product is a composable software-defined infrastructure allowing customers to easily deploy one or more virtual servers through the HPE OneView management software.* 

*For the solution level HPE Synergy program, I write the start here poster (resource), cabling guide, and software release information. I also serve as a product expert evaluating all other deliverables to ensure content consistency and content sharing best practices.*

## ConvergedSystem 700

*HPE ConvergedSystem 700 is pre-configured and purpose compute, networking, and storage solution designed using HPE components. This product reduces the headaches associated with buying off-the-shelf products and attempting to negotiate the various firmware and software dependencies between components.*

*For this program, I write firmware and software compatibility matrices and step-by-step update guides. The update guides include firmware updates, software updates, VMware ESXi configuration, and switch configuration.*

## HPE SimpliVity 380

*HPE Hyper Converged 380 (or HPE SimpliVity 380) is a node-based server solution allowing quick install, configuration, and enhanced scalability. This product is delivered as a single server and management software pre-configured with a focus on virtual machine deployment.*

*For this program I worked on the initial deployment which was run on an aggressive schedule.*
