Each frame link module contains an Ethernet switch that manages all HPE Synergy internal frame management network connections. Frame link modules also manage management ring (frame link topology) connections.

Independent midplane signal connections and independent bay connections provide fault tolerance.

Frame link module Ethernet ports supporting the appliance bays run at 10Gb. Ethernet ports supporting the device and interconnect bays run at 1Gb.
