# Writing Samples

My writing samples include current HP/Poly samples and older HPE samples. While my current work involves a lot of research, testing, and implementation, I'm not necessarily writing about complex subjects. I'd say that the main goal is to provide accurate task-based information to ensure customers are connecting, configuring, and deploying their systems correctly.

Poly documentation style guide dictates that all documentation is task-based. There are few in-depth explanations of technologies or functionality. For HPE, I worked on more complicated documentation for the HPE Synergy, Hyper Converged, and ConvergeSystems products.

## HP | Poly

At Poly, I work on new and sustaining products. Documentation includes release notes, administrator guides, user guides, API guides, and other compliance-driven documentation. In addition, I work with the product services readiness and marketing team to assist with and review training materials and instructional videos.

In addition to working on VideoOS documentation, I provide feedback on UI designs, review UI strings, and participate in beta software trials with Poly equipment.

### Poly VideoOS Software Documentation

The Poly Video Mode Administrator Guide is a comprehensive guide for the Poly VideoOS software that runs on Poly Studio G and Studio X codecs.
This guide provides information from onboarding a system to configuring network and security settings in the system web interface.

### Poly Studio G62

This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up the Poly Studio G62 with video and audio conferencing peripherals.

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

At HPE, I authored hardware and software release notes, administrator guides, user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and firmware compatibility matrices. 

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I redesigned a Start Here poster, a cabling guide, and software release content. To complete this project, I worked directly with the engineering team in the lab and had access to the product's virtual test environment.

### HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

I worked on various components of the HPE Synergy project, but the frame link module was my main product. I joined the team after the initial launch, quickly learning the product and becoming an information lead. After getting up to speed, I noticed the same inconsistent terminology used for the command line interface management tool. I worked with the team to update the terminology database and reduce customer confusion.

### ConvergedSystem 700

The ConvergedSystem product consists of various HPE hardware components and software from third-party companies. ConvergedSystems is a complex product requiring the intricate verification that all software and firmware work together without issue.

### HPE Hyper Converged 380

The Hyper Converged 380 was a new product similar to ConvergedSystems, but using only one server. I worked on the launch of this program as the writer for the user guide, compatibility matrix, and release notes. For the administrator guide, I met with engineers in our data center for a step-by-step walkthrough of the procedures.
