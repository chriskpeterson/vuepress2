# Writing Samples

At Poly, I work on new and existing products writing release notes, administrator guides, user guides, API guides, and various other compliance-driven documentation.
While I work on documentation, a large part of my role is leading the team and the overall video documentation strategy. 

At HPE, I authored hardware and software release notes, administrator guides, user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and firmware compatibility matrices. 

At both Poly and HPE, I worked on additional internal projects and served on work streams. I included some of these projects in [Projects](projects.md).

### Integrator's Guide

HP | Poly customers have been asking for an integrator's guide for a number of years. The last guide was created for a legacy product released in 2017.
I proposed creating a similar technical document for the new Poly Studio G62 video codec.


## Poly

At Poly, I've worked on both voice and video products. My first product was the CCX business media phone working on all required documentation. Currently, I work on high-visibility video products and occasionally help with new voice products.

I've included a few work samples for products currently on the market.

### Poly VideoOS Hardware and Software Documentation

Poly Partner Mode Administrator Guide


## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I redesigned a Start Here poster, a cabling guide, and software release content. To complete this project, I worked directly with the engineering team in the lab and had access to the product's virtual test environment.

### HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

I worked on various components of the HPE Synergy project, but the frame link module was my main product. I joined the team after the initial launch, quickly learning the product and becoming an information lead. After getting up to speed, I noticed the same terminology was being used for the CLI management tool for multiple components. I worked with the team to update the terminology database and reduce customer confusion.

### ConvergedSystem 700

The ConvergedSystem product consists of various HPE hardware components and software from multiple other companies. ConvergedSystems is a complex product requiring the team to verify that all software and firmware work together without issues. To upgrade the software or update the firmware, you must follow an exact sequence of steps across each product. Some upgrades require skipping and hopping around the system updating firmware. In these instances, I guided the team to provide the best structure for customer success. For this program, I wrote firmware and software compatibility matrices and step-by-step upgrade guides.

### HPE Hyper Converged 380

The Hyper Converged 380 was a new product similar to ConvergedSystems, but using only one server. I worked on the launch of this program as the writer for the user guide, compatibility matrix, and release notes. The administrator guide writer and I worked closely and met with engineers in our data center to go step by step through the procedures.
