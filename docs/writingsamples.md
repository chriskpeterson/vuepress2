# Writing Samples

At Poly, I write software administrator and user guides, hardware setup guides, and release notes for voice and video products.

At HPE, I wrote hardware and software user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and firmware compatibility matrices. In addition, I worked on release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements.

At both Poly and HPE, I worked on additional internal projects and served on work streams. I included some of these projects in [Projects](projects.md).

Please use the links below to view writing samples from Poly and HPE.

## Poly

At Poly, I've worked on both voice and video products. I started working on CCX business media phones full suite of guides. Currently I work on high visibility video products and occasionally help with new voice products.

I've included a few samples of work for products currently on the market.

### Poly CCX Business Media Phones with UC Software

Helping launch the CCX phones was my first project at Poly. I have since turned this project over to a junior writer providing guidance and assistance.

### Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

The team views me as the problem solver. We had issues selling this product due to incomplete documentation. I took this over to help identify gaps in the information provided to us by our SMEs.

The team provided me with a Poly G40-T Microsoft Teams Solution. I worked through the steps, reviewed Microsoft's documentation, and proposed a more comprehensive HTML document to the team.

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I redesigned a start here poster, cabling guide, and software release content. To complete this project, I worked directly with the engineering team in the lab and had access to the product's virtual test environment.

In addition to the poster, I worked on the HPE Synergy Cabling Guide. When I took the guide over, we provided one incomplete cabling diagram for each cabling scenario. Working with the product team, I created a step-by-step cabling guide to add clarity and simplify the cabling process.

### HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

I worked on various components of the HPE Synergy project, but the frame link module was my main product. I joined the team after the initial launch, quickly learning the product and becoming an information lead. After getting up to speed, I noticed the same terminology was being used for the CLI management tool for multiple components. I worked with the team to update the terminology database and reduce customer confusion.

### HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

For this program, I work on in-the-box print deliverables and the user guide. HPE servers each have their separate guides, but there's a high percentage of reuse across the server guides.

### ConvergedSystem 700

The ConvergedSystem product consists of various HPE hardware components and software from multiple other companies. ConvergedSystems is a complex program because there are often compatibility issues. To upgrade the software or update the firmware, you must follow an exact sequence of steps across each product. For this program, I wrote firmware and software compatibility matrices and step-by-step upgrade guides.

### HPE Hyper Converged 380

The Hyper Converged 380 was a new product similar to ConvergedSystems, but with fewer components. I worked on the launch of this program as the writer for the user guide, compatibility matrix, and release notes.

## Topic analysis and rewrite exercise

To demonstrate how I think when writing or updating content, I choose two existing topics to evaluate and rewrite.
