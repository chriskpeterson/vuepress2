# Writing samples

Please find a link to some of the content I've created at Poly and HPE. These samples are mostly task, concept, and reference topics At HPE, I write user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and software and firmware compatibility matrices. In the past, I've written release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements for high-security customers.

Below, I've listed some of the programs I work on with a link to a writing sample for each.


## Poly CCX Business Media Phones with UC Software

## HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

For this program, I work on the various in-box print deliverables and the user guide. The content in HPE server guides doesn't change much, but there are small differences between products. These guides are the focus of my content reuse project currently in progress.
