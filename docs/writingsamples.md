# Writing Samples

My writing samples include current HP/Poly samples and older HPE samples. While my current work involves a lot of digging, testing, and implementing, I'm not necessarily writing about complex subjects. I'd say that the main goal is to provide accurate information to ensure customers are connecting, configuring, and deploying their systems correctly.

Poly documentation tends to be short and to the point with the style guide dictating that all documentation is task-based. There are few in-depth explanations of technologies or functionality. This is something I'm currently working on changing with the Poly Studio G62 Integrator Reference Guide.

At both Poly and HPE, I worked on additional internal projects and served on work streams. I included some of these projects in [Projects](projects.md).

## HP | Poly

At Poly, I work on new and sustaining products writing release notes, administrator guides, user guides, API guides, and other compliance-driven documentation.
While I work on documentation, a large part of my role is leading the team and the overall video documentation strategy. 

In addition to working on VideoOS documentation, I provide feedback on UI designs, review UI strings, and participate in beta software trials with Poly equipment.

### Poly VideoOS Software Documentation

The Poly Video Mode Administrator Guide is a comprehensive guide for the Poly VideoOS software that runs on Poly Studio G and Studio X codecs.
This guide provides information from onboarding a system to configuring network and security settings in the system web interface.

### Poly Studio G62

HP | Poly customers have asked for an integrator's guide for several years. The last guide was created for a legacy product released in 2017.
I proposed creating a similar technical document for the new Poly Studio G62 video codec.

### Poly VideoOS

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

At HPE, I authored hardware and software release notes, administrator guides, user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and firmware compatibility matrices. 

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I redesigned a Start Here poster, a cabling guide, and software release content. To complete this project, I worked directly with the engineering team in the lab and had access to the product's virtual test environment.

### HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

I worked on various components of the HPE Synergy project, but the frame link module was my main product. I joined the team after the initial launch, quickly learning the product and becoming an information lead. After getting up to speed, I noticed the same terminology was being used for the CLI management tool for multiple components. I worked with the team to update the terminology database and reduce customer confusion.

### ConvergedSystem 700

The ConvergedSystem product consists of various HPE hardware components and software from multiple other companies. ConvergedSystems is a complex product requiring the team to verify that all software and firmware work together without issues. To upgrade the software or update the firmware, you must follow an exact sequence of steps across each product. Some upgrades require skipping and hopping around the system updating firmware. In these instances, I guided the team to provide the best structure for customer success. For this program, I wrote firmware and software compatibility matrices and step-by-step upgrade guides.

### HPE Hyper Converged 380

The Hyper Converged 380 was a new product similar to ConvergedSystems, but using only one server. I worked on the launch of this program as the writer for the user guide, compatibility matrix, and release notes. For the administrator guide, I met with engineers in our data center for a step-by-step walkthrough of the procedures.
