# Projects

Here are some projects I'm currently working on in my current role.

## Content sharing

I'm currently working on a template for our server platform allowing writers to update multiple variable files to create a version specific to each server. Most of our server guides include the same topics, but they include specific product names and illustrations. Using one variable file for company and product-specific variables and another variable file for illustrations will greatly reduce topic duplication.

## Augmented Reality

A colleague and I create an augmented reality (AR) template tool for server cabling. (You can see it [HPE ProLiant Gen10 DL380 Cabling Matrix](https://techhub.hpe.com/eginfolib/servers/CableMatrix/GUID-76C9E454-E5AA-4A65-BA5E-132A7D306E07.html) here.) This was done using JavaScript which has limited functionality for AR. We are currently looking at options to developer this further.
