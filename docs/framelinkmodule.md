The following sample is an explanation of the management network. The product team was adamant that this content be included in the user guide as it is a core selling point for this product and critical to customer understanding as they setup their solution.

This sample includes a few sections from the guide including component identification, setup, operations, and an explanation of the frame management network.

The frame management network concept topic (page 21) was requested by the product team to ensure that customers understood the product's internal and external management network. This is a long topic that you could argue should be multiple topic. This is a topic I would revisit in the future for condensing and possible restructure into multiple topics.
