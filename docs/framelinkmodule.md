# HPE Synergy Frame Link Module

**Role:** Project lead and lead writer

**Tools:** SDL and XMetaL

------

This sample includes sections from the product user guide including component identification, setup, operations, and an explanation of the frame management network.

The frame management network topic, on page 21, was requested by the product team to promote customer understanding of the internal and external management network. This topic is definitely a candidate for being split into multiple topics.
