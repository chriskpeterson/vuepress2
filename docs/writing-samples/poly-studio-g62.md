## Poly Studio G62 Integrator Guide

HP | Poly customers have requested an integrator's guide for years. The last guide, created in 2017, was for a now-discontinued product. This old guide is often referenced, along with the statement, "We want something like this again." Despite limited resources, I proposed the creation of an updated integrator guide for the Poly Studio G62 video codec.

Based on feedback from integrators, I've added cabling diagrams illustrating room-size configurations. System limitations restrict the number of diagrams included.
