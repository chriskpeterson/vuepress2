# Department Projects and Work Streams

At Poly and HPE, I participated in various work streams and department initiatives.

## Poly

### Taxonomy and Metadata

Worked with our editing team to update the product documentation library taxonomy. As part of this project, I worked with Zoomin to implement their metadata to facets publishing plugin. Using this plugin ensures that topics utilize consistent metadata tagging and saves publishing time by a few hours.

### [Poly In-the-Box Setup Sheet Evaluation](case-studies/setup-sheet-eval.md)

For most types of content, the web is the best place to put it. However, for hardware products that ship in boxes, the best place to find instructions is in the box.

Management asked me to send out an internal survey and compile the results. The goal was to reduce in-the-box documentation cost. First, they wanted to better understand how services and customers utilize the in-the-box documentation.

[Poly Documentation Library Redesign](doc-library-redesign)

Provided input toward the redesign of the Poly Documentation Library.


### API Documentation

[Postman API Documentation Research](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13192773/TVYDdKDz)

Investigated software to help our team write API documentation for both video and voice. I taught other team members how to run API commands on our voice products.

### Quality team

This team evaluates support cases flagged for potential documentation issues. In one case, we identified that customers continued to call in about a particular server setup procedure. We were able to borrow the server and confirmed that the process, as documented, was unclear. We updated the guide and leading to a reduction in service calls.
