# Content Development



## Poly

* ### [UC Software Administrator Guide Redesign](case-studies/admin-guide-redesign.md)

Customers prefer task-based guides. Ideally, when a customer wants to know how to enable, disable, or configure a feature they can find content that tells them how to do it.


* ### [Poly In-the-Box Setup Sheet Evaluation](case-studies/setup-sheet-eval.md)

For most types of content, the web is the best place to put it. However, for hardware products that ship in boxes, the best place to find instructions is in the box.

Management asked me to send out an internal survey and compile the results. The goal was to reduce in-the-box documentation cost. First, they wanted to better understand how services and customers utilize the in-the-box documentation.

### [Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Roomw](case-studies/poly.mtr.md)

Customers were returning units due to inadequate instructions. Putting too much information on a small setup sheet and depending on third party partner's documentation caused customer dissatisfaction.

## HPE

* ### [Interactive Documentation](case-studies/interactive-documentation)

I'm very interested in interactive documentation delivery models. I believe we can reduce task complexity by allowing customers to choose options and retrieve relevant content. We realized this with the HPE Synergy Firmware Comparison Tool. Customers reported fewer issues understanding the supported software and firmware for their solution. Even better, we received positive feedback from customers and the field.

* ### [HPE Synergy Firmware Compatibility Matrix](case-studies/interactive-matrix.md)

When I worked on HPE Synergy, it was HPE's premier product. The team wanted everything, including documentation, to celebrate this next generation blade server. In fact, documentation was considered a critical component and received more attention than it typically does.

* ### [HPE Synergy Cabling Guide](case-studies/synergy-cabling-guide.md)

When I was asked to update this guide, I looked at one we had and proposed a new content structure. I sold the idea to my program manager and started work on a overhaul of the guide.

* ### [HPE ProLiant Cabling Matrix](case-studies/proliant-cabling-matrix.md)

Hard drive cabling in a server can be tricky. In some cases, there are over forty combinations of cables you might use depending on how many drives you have installed, what type of drives, and which drive controllers the server using.
