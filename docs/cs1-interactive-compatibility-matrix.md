# Case Study 1: Interactive Compatibility Matrix


## Background

HPE's Synergy product is composed of multiple pieces of hardware with around 80 components requiring individual firmware packages. Tying this all together are two pieces of software with their own versions and compatibility challenges. 
HPE's customers were finding it difficult to understand which software and firmware packages were compatibility with their environment.

The firmware team presented this challenge to Knowledge Manage. How can we present the software and firmware compatibility information in a way that's easy for customers to understand and act on?

## Research

The team provided me with an Excel spreadsheet with 80 rows and 20 columns. This spreadsheet included the firmware and software compatibility information. Initially, the team was going to just send this spreadsheet to customers.

In Knowledge Management, we were mandated to use our SLD CMS for all deliverables. So, this firmware and software information would be required to be added to and published through SDL.
