# ConvergedSystem 700

*For this program, I am the project lead and lead writer. Currently, I work with another writer to create and update content for this program.* 

*This product was built to allow customer to easily maintain it themselves, however most customers choose to purchase a care package as it is not easy to navigate the various component dependencies. Because of the difficulty to upgrade the components, I worked with the engineering team to create a step-by-step upgrade grade. This is one of the only guides I work on that is made up almost exclusively of tasks.*

*In its entirety, this guide is proprietary for entitled customers only. Here is one topic from the guide covering uploading a VMware VIMsetup file.*

   ### Sample of the update dependency and time section

   This is a step-by-step updates guide. I like to refer to it as a page turner as the customer will need to follow this guide in order and perform each step. Here is a sample of the section where we cover task order and time to complete.
