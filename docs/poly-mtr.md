# Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

My manager asked me to help solve a customer satisfaction issue for the Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms product. Potential customers were returning demo units with the complaint that the setup and configuration information was unclear.

I picked up a demo unit from the office and set it up in my home lab. The team insisted that this product needed very few instructions, so the program's writer complied by creating a simple PDF setup sheet. Going through the setup process, it was clear critical information was missing.

To solve this issue, I created an HTML setup walkthrough breaking down the steps into smaller chunks. In addition, I made sure links to the Microsoft website went directly to the information and did not require the customer to search for it.

I'll soon replace the current version with a second iteration. As we added additional supported products, I broke up the individual solutions into separate chunked topics. By separating the solutions setup instructions, customers can more easily identify and capture only the information they need.
