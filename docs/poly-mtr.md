# Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

To address usability, I broke away from the standar DITA topic-based model and created a walkthrough experience. Ultimately, as new solutions and supported products were added, I had to reevaluate the approach and reformat the document. Part of this process required that I dig deeper into DITA and learn how to add a topic to a document four times. Typically, this is not a recommended approach.
