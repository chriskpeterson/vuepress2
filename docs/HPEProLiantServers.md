# HPE DL385 ProLiant Server



**Role:** Lead writer

**Tools:** SDL and XMetaL

------

We have numerous products in the ProLiant server line. I work on one of them, the HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server. As part of my current work on this project, I reworking the common content into reusable content. Previously, writers would duplicate content to create specific xrefs or add specific illustrations. I'm working to add variable functionality which will reduce the each topic from more than twenty duplicate topics to a single reusable topic.

This sample shows how server tasks are structured. The steps use simplified English relying on the illustrations for detailed instructions. This is not quite a superprocedure, but does contain summary steps. Summary steps are used to reduce customer fatigue in reading the basic known steps in each procedure.
