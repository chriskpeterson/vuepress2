# HPE ProLiant Servers



I work on the following server user guide. The linked copy is an update to the version I initially created last year. This was a new product so the guide was created using our server guide template, not through XXXXXXXXXX

[HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 Server User Guide - sample](https://chriskpeterson.github.io/vuepress2/public/DL385_sample.pdf)

Based on precedent, the server guide content is structured in this order:

* Component identification
* Operations
* Setup
* Hardware options installation
* Cabling
* Software and configuration utilities

The teams prefers that we first cover the components of the server before addressing component installation.
