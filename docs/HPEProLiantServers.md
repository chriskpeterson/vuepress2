We have numerous products in the ProLiant server line. I work on one of them, the HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 server. As part of my current work on this project, I reworking the common content into reusable content. Previously, writers would duplicate content to create specific xrefs or add specific illustrations. I'm working to add variable functionality which will reduce the each topic from more than twenty duplicate topics to a single reusable topic.

This sample includes some of our basic hardware procedures. In the hardware procedure, the steps are written in simplified English with supporting illustrations.
