# HPE DL385 ProLiant Server



**Role:** Lead writer

**Tools:** SDL and XMetaL

------

The following sample is from the HPE ProLiant DL385 Gen10 Server User Guide. My work on this guide includes reworking the common content topics into template-based reusable content. Previously, writers would duplicate content to create xrefs or add illustrations. 

This sample shows how server tasks are structured. The steps use simplified English relying on illustrations for detailed instructions. In some of the hardware procedures, we use summary steps to reduce customer fatigue in reading the basic steps in each procedure.
