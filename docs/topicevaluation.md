# Topic evaluation

*I thought it would be a good idea to provide a few samples of rewrites to demonstrate how I think through topic writing.*

## Sample 1

> ### Powering On and Off
> After you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with the RealPresence Group Series system, connect the power cable and power on the system. Note that Polycom RealPresence Group 300, 310, 500, and 700 systems do not have what you might think of as a power *button*â€”they have a power *proximity sensor*. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power on the front of the system.

-----

*If tasked with updating this topic, I would make a few changes including structuring it as a task and removing information about features no longer present. Understanding there is no longer a power button could be added to the front of the document. After a few generations, customers will understand that the button is now a sensor.*

*Also, we don't know how close to the sensor we should get or how sensitive the sensor is. Is it possible to get too close and accidently turn of the unit? Researching this topic, I would make sure to address this.*

# Sample 2

## Reset your portal password

If you forget your password to the portal, reset it from the login page.

------
**NOTE:** If you enter the wrong credentials three times your account is locked for a 15 minute period, during which you cannot access your account.

------

**Steps**

1. From the portal login page, click **Change My Password**.
The Recover Password screen is shown.
2. Enter your email address and click **Submit**.
You'll receive an email link with details of how to reset your password.

------

*The topic discusses resetting the password, but uses the word 'credentials' in the note. I would use 'password' throughout.* 

*I believe the customer would understand that an account lock would result in no account access. It may be worthwhile to include what to do if your account is locked. Can you reset your password to gain access? If so, we could include that in the note.*
