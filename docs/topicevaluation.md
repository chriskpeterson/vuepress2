# Topic evaluation

_I thought it would be a good idea to provide a few samples of rewrites to show my thought process._

## Sample 1

> ### Powering On and Off
>
> After you have connected all of the equipment that you will use with the RealPresence Group Series system, connect the power cable and power on the system. Note that Polycom RealPresence Group 300, 310, 500, and 700 systems do not have what you might think of as a power _button_â€”they have a power _proximity sensor_. Instead of pressing an actual button that moves, you touch the sensor (or near the sensor) that indicates power on the front of the system.

---

_For this topic, I'd restructure it as a task and remove information about features no longer on the product.._

_Also, we don't know how close to the sensor we should get or how sensitive the sensor is. Is it possible to get too close and accidentally turn off the unit? _

### Rewrite

> #### Powering On the RealPresence Group Series system
>
> ::: tip NOTE
> The product powers on with a proximity sensor switch. The proximity sensor switch is the power button icon located on the front of the unit.
> :::
>
> ::: tip NOTE
> Only connect peripheral devices when the product is powered off.
> :::
>
> 1. Connect all peripheral devices.
> 2. Connect power to the system.
> 3. To power on the system, press the power button icon.

## Sample 2

### Reset your portal password

If you forget your password to the portal, reset it from the login page.

::: tip NOTE
If you enter the wrong credentials three times your account is locked for a 15 minute period, during which you cannot access your account.
:::

**Steps**

1. From the portal login page, click **Change My Password**.
   The Recover Password screen is shown.
2. Enter your email address and click **Submit**.
   You'll receive an email link with details of how to reset your password.

_The topic discusses resetting the password but uses the word 'credentials' in the note. I would use 'password' throughout the topic._

_I believe the customer would understand that an account lock would result in no account access. It may be worthwhile to include what to do if your account is locked. Can you reset your password to gain access? If so, we could add it to the note._
