# Poly CCX Business Media Phones

As my first program, I launched Poly's new line of phones, the CCX series. Much of the content was from existing guides as we heavily reuse content across voice documentation.

## Task-Based Administrator Guide Rewrite

Mid last year, I proposed a project to rewrite the administrator guides for our voice projects. The guides were a mix of concept and reference topics with very few task topics. This type of guide doesn't allow a customer to approach it with a question. For example, if a customer wanted to find out how to change the admin password, they'd find a concept about it and a reference with the parameter, but they wouldn't find a topic that explained how to change the password.

Management sponsored the project, and we started working on it late last year. Ultimately, due to my workload, another colleague managed the project. I moved into a support role, helping convert the topics.

Here are a few chapters I worked on:

## CCX with Microsoft Teams Quick Tips

The sales team approached the documentation team for help. Their customer requested a quick tips document for our CCX phones with Microsoft Teams. I quickly created the Microsoft Teams quick tips to ensure we closed on the sale.
