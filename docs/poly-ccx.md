# Writing samples

Below, I've included samples of my work at Poly and HPE.

## Poly

At Poly, I write software administrator and user guides, setup sheets, and release notes for voice and video products. As a documentation prime, I create documentation plans, attend core team meetings, work with scrum teams, and write and edit strings for our UX team.

In addition to my program work, I also work on other internal projects and serve on internal teams. Some of these projects are outlined in [Projects](projects.md).

The technical communications group at Poly utilizes reuse across all products. Voice products, in particular, reuse much of the same content. For this reason, I don't have significant writing samples to share.

### Poly CCX Business Media Phones with UC Software

As my first assignment, I was the documentation prime for Poly's new line of phones, the CCX series.

### Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

As I've grown in my role, I've been in a hybrid position working on programs that need special attention. For this product, I helped solve a customer satisfaction issue by working with the product and identifying information gaps.

### Poly VideoOS Device Mode UX Copy

## Hewlett Packard Enterprise

At HPE, I wrote user guides, update guides, setup overviews, and software and firmware compatibility matrices. In the past, I've written release notes, OS installation guides, and volatility statements for high-security customers.

### HPE Synergy

For this program, I work on a start here poster (printed and shipped in the box), cabling guide, and content for each software release.

### HPE ProLiant DL385 Server

For this program, I work on the various in-box print deliverables and the user guide. The content in HPE server guides doesn't change much, but there are small differences between products. These guides are the focus of my content reuse project currently in progress.
