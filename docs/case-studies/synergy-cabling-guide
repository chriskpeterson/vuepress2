# HPE Synergy Cabling guide


## Evaluation

When I started working on HPE Synergy, the fist version of the cabling guide was already published.

The first thing I did was make sure the cabling diagrams were correct. After talking to SMEs, I found that the cabling guides did not show every cable required for each scenario.

* Some cabling scenarios didn't include additional cabling required for some configurations
* The cabling diagrams included every cable in one illustration.

## Solution

Ideally, I wanted to create an interactive cabling guide allowing customers to select the component they wanted to see cabled. However, given the requirements, and that the guide needed to be delivered both online and as a PDF, I choose a different strategy.

* Each cabling scenario included a step by step cabling guide.
* At the end of the walkthrough a final illustration showed all the cables.
* I included every component that needed to be cabled for each scenario.
* I added additional colors to differentiate what each was for.
* The final diagram is not ideal for colorblind customers, but the step-by-step instructions don't rely on colors as they show each step one-by-one.
