# Poly Solutions for Microsoft Teams Rooms

**Role:** Lead writer

**Tools:** Adobe Illustrator, Oxygen, and Vasont


## Problem

Customers were provided units to test before purchasing. The customers were returning the units with the complaint that they didn't know how to set them up. Our documentation was insufficient.

My manager asked me to pick up a unit from the office to set up in my home lab. I went through the setup procedure and found multiple gaps in the documentation.

This was a case of trying to figure out what we should document for a third party app. Depending on the third party to provide sufficient documentation may lead to customer dissatisfaction.

## Research

I picked up a demo unit from the office and set it up in my home lab. The team insisted that this product needed very few instructions, so the program's writer complied by creating a simple PDF setup sheet. Going through the setup process, it was clear that critical information was missing.

Going through the system setup, I noted:

* We were missing critical information on our setup sheet.
For example, that default admin password.
* We made assumptions about what the customer knows and about the usability of Microsoft's help center.
* Cabling is complex and can't be adequately shown in one diagram.
* There were so many different cables with the system it was difficult to figure out which cable was for which component.

I created a quick task flow diagram to show how similar setup is for each solution.

## Solution

My solution was to create a single HTML deliverable that included the information for each of the solutions. Other than the camera that ships with the solution, everything else is the same.

I made sure links to the Microsoft website went directly to the information and did not require the customer to search for it.

I broke up the individual solutions into separate chunked topics. By separating the solutions setup instructions, customers can more easily identify and capture only the information they need.

To outline the flow of the document, I created a setup diagram.
