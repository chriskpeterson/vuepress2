title: Compatibility Matrix

I identified a knowledge gap regarding supported configurations with Poly video products. This included working with the Interoperatiblty Testing Team, the Software Quality Assurance team, product management, and interviewing integrators and customers.

Through my research, I found that the release notes were considered the single source of truth and not a central knowledge repository or wiki. 

To correct this, I created a Confluence page to act as the single source of truth and worked with the development team and product management on a strategy to update the page for each release. Using the Confluence page as a guide, I created a compatibility matrix with specific information on supported configurations by product and conferencing provider.
