# Administrator Guide Rewrite (Poly)

The Poly administrator guides were not being referenced on the documentation site. Instead, customers were referencing the Poly community forums, blogs created by Poly engineers, or calling support.

I'd noted in the past that as a new employee it was difficult to user our documentation to set up and configure a phone. I felt we needed a task-based guide that provided clear instructions on:

* What's required to get the phone working
* Recommended configuration tasks such as security and networking
* Additional features and settings a administrator may want to utilize

I proposed this project to management and the team detailing the requirements in a presentation and documentation plan. Once the project started, a coworker managed the work through Jira and I took on a supporting role.

## Problem

Customers approach information searches with a question. Typically, the question is how do I do something. A guide composed of concept and referenced topics doesn't tell you how to complete a task. Instead, the customer is required to put the task together themselves often leading to frustration and calls to support.

The current administrator guides don’t show customers how to perform tasks. Instead, they’re a mix of resource and parameter topics requiring a customer to look through lists of parameters and figure out which ones they need to configure their phones.


## Process

Once the project kicked off, we met with the program manager, SMEs, looked through our community forums, and researched competitors administrator guides.

I worked on a new task template including the structure of the parameters referenced in the topics. I brought template ideas to our biweekly IA meetings to decide on a final structure. Once agreed upon, I constructed the template in our CCMS.

The voice products writing team banded together and worked on the topics. This required gaining a better understanding of the features which often resulted in SME consultations.

After six months of hard work, outside of program work, the first two guides were complete.


## Solution

The team delivered a reworked administrator guide using task-based instructions to better guide customers in using parameters and achieving their goals.

**Example from the previous guide:**

Do Not Disturb

If a customer wanted to configure sever-based do not disturb, they may search for "do not disturb."

They would find two do not disturb concepts.

The customer would then have to look through this list of parameters to figure out which ones they needed to configure the server-based do not distrub features.

**Example from the new guide:**

The new guide provides the instructions, including all parameters required to enable and configure the feature.
