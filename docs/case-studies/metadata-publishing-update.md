# Metadata and Publishing Updated

I'm grouping these two together because these projects go hand-in-hand.

I inherited the publishing portion of this project from a colleague that left the company. It hadn't been figured out yet so I worked with Zoomin to implement and test their metadata plugin.

The plugin worked by converting metadata in the othermeta DITA element to selectable facets on the Zoomin documentation library.

## Problem

Publishing is a cumbersome task due to the requirement to add metadata tags to topics each time you publish a document. This process wasn't only for new content but was required every time you publish any document.
