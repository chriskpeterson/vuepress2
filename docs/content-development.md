# Content Development



## Poly

* [UC Software Administrator Guide Redesign](admin-guide-redesign.md)
Customer prefer task-based guides. Ideally, when a customer wants to know how to enable, disable, or configure a feature they can find content that tells them how to do it.
* [Poly Documentation Library Redesign](doc-library-redesign)
Around the time I started working at Poly, they were discussing how to document third party apps running on Poly devices.
* [Third Party App Documentation](third-party-documentation.md)
* [Poly In-the-Box Setup Sheet Evaluation](setup-sheet-eval.md)
Management asked me to send out an internal survey and compile the results. The goal was to reduce in-the-box documentation cost. First, they wanted to better understand how services and customers utilize the in-the-box documentation.



## HPE

* [HPE Synergy Firmware Compatibility Matrix](interactive-matrix.md)
* [HPE ProLiant Cabling Matrix](proliant-cabling-matrix.md)
