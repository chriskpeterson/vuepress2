# Topic dependencies

In topic writing, the goal is to create topics that can stand alone. We deal with many issues when writing using this methodology including:

## Why can't I include the product name in my topic

This is a great question, because if i want a particular topic to stand alone, such as "Powering down the server" how can a customer find it if the title does not incidicate the product discussed?

## What about topic to topic linking? 

When a link to another topic is included in the body of a topic, not the relationship table, it create a dependency between two or more topics. If many linked topics all have links themselves it begins to create a confusing train of topics that can easily become unmanageable.
